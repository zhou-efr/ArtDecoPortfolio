## Usage
It isn't filled-up but would be easy to do so. The masonry is automatised, making easier to add some news projects or just link the portfolio to GitHub or other kind of storage. 

If anybody wants to reuse it, here is the color pallet : 

| color     | hex code |
|:----------|:--------:|
| Gold      | #C2934D  |
| Skin      | #D2CCC7  |
| Blue      | #314E60  |
| Gray      | #6C747C  |
| Blue Gray | #85A1AE  |

The vectors used are all from [noun-project](https://thenounproject.com) (see credits bellow).  
Title font is [Parklane](https://www.1001fonts.com/parklane-font.html), and the other is [Semplicita](https://www.1001fonts.com/semplicita-font.html) (light and medium). 

Please kindly note that the mail section isn't configure yet.
## Technologies
The website is code in basic html, however it contains some standalone [ReactJS](https://fr.reactjs.org/) to program the automatic masonry. Finally, the css is done with [TailwindCss](https://tailwindcss.com).
